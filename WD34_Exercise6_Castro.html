						<h1>CULTURAL HERITAGE</h1>
						<p>Discover Palawan’s fascinating history and traditions</p>
						<p>Whenever “Palawan” is mentioned, the first thing that comes to people’s minds are the majestic sceneries that are found in the island that was recently proclaimed as the most beautiful island in the world for the second time.
						However, Palawan is more than just crystal clear waters and white sand beaches. Palawan’s culture is very fascinating. Its unique cultural heritage consisting of a blend of tribal traditions and Spanish culture elements.
						</p>
						<p>From ancient times, colonizations and Japanese invasion. Long before it became “The Best Island in the World” and became a major tourist destination, Palawan had a significant role over the years especially during those dark days of colonization from one colonizer to another.</p><br>
						Travelling to Palawan
						Palawan’s covert, unscathed charm is alluring to nature lovers. Getting there is tough, so it is best to contact a travel agency or local guides to explore this part of Palawan. Although the airport of Puerto Princesa is now considered an international airport, currently only very few flights fly in from abroad. So the best way to reach Palawan would still be to first fly into a bigger airport in the Philippines – most likely through Metro Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport – and then take a domestic flight to Palawan. From Manila, it’s approximately a one-hour plane ride to Puerto Princesa. Another way to get to Palawan is through Busuanga (Coron) via Philippine Airlines, SkyJet and Cebu Pacific from Manila.</p>

							With a history beginning with prehistoric settlement (seen in the ancient tribal artworks of the Tabon Caves) and proceeding through Malaysian migration, Spanish colonisation, American rule and Japanese invasion, Palawan is much more than its blissful white-sand beaches and incredible natural resources. This is also a province where around 70 cultures live together in harmony, with different languages and dialects (more than 50), beliefs, festivals, art forms and tribes. The best places to get a handle on this heterogeneity are the National Museum and Palawan Museum in Puerto Princesa.
							Palawan also has a rich food culture into which all these influences have fed. Among local treats to seek out and sample are superfresh seafood including tamilok (a shell-less saltwater clam, served ceviche-style or fried), crocodile sisig (a sizzling minced-meat dish), lato seaweed salad, hopia bread (a sweet flaky pastry best eaten at Baker’s Hill in Puerto Princesa), danggit lamayo (dried rabbitfish) and chao long (Vietnamese-inspired noodles). Foodies should also make a beeline for San Jose Market in Puerto Princesa.</p>

								<p class="coronBody"> Coron is famous for wreck diving, thanks to the number of Japanese ships that sunk in these waters during World War 2. Back in 1944, the US Navy launched a coordinated attack on the Imperial Japanese Navy docked in Manila Bay. The fleet tried to escape and hide in Coron but they were tracked and eventually gunned down in their supposed shelter. Now, these shipwrecks are covered with colourful corals teeming with many different kinds of fish.</p>

								<p class="portbaronBody"> Port Barton is just a small village along the western coast of northern Palawan. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a town. It is simply one of the barangays of the municipality of San Vicente. The confusion probably stems from the fact that when locals say “San Vicente,” they usually refer to the town proper (near Long Beach). Because Port Barton is 3 hours away from the poblacion (town proper) by land, it is always mistaken as a separate municipality.</p>
